# Workers architecture

This document describes the Workers framework and its Vite integration.
The upstream base is `ed886996d1d3780b94166af4f798c53416d547c8`.

## Goal

Expose a Workers-native Fetch handler and run the same application in Cloudflare's Vite development environment and Wrangler's local built-output host.
D1 and other storage integrations are intentionally deferred by the user.
No container, Bun process, cloud deployment, PR, or npm publishing is required.

## Runtime boundaries

```mermaid

  Host[Workers fetch request / env / executionContext] --> Adapter[@effront/core/workers createFetchHandler]
  Adapter --> Context[Request-scoped Effect context and application Layer]
  Context --> HTTP[Effect HttpRouter.toWebHandler]
  HTTP --> RSC[RSC graph: application and Flight rendering]
  RSC --> SSR[SSR graph: renderHtml]
  RSC --> Flight[Flight Web stream]
  SSR --> HTML[HTML Web stream with embedded Flight]
  HTML --> Browser[Client graph: hydration and navigation]
  Flight --> Browser
```

`createFetchHandler` creates the application Layer for each request, not once globally.
This permits Layer acquisition to access the current environment and avoids sharing request-specific resources across Workers requests.
Both Layer acquisition and the handler's Effect context receive the same Workers context.
The response body's EOF, error, or cancellation owns request-scope disposal.

`getWorkersEnv<Env>()` and `getWorkersRequestContext<Env, ExecutionContext>()` retrieve typed host values without copying them into a serialization format.
`createWorkersContextAccessors<Env, ExecutionContext>()` binds both types once and returns zero-argument Effect-producing readers of the same request Context.
The generic defaults are unknown for both types.
`@effront/cloudflare/workers` wraps the factory with a fixed `{ waitUntil(promise: Promise<unknown>): void }` execution context and accepts only Env.
Its runtime export is separate from the package's Vite plugin entry.
Factories create readers, not additional services or Layers, and preserve request/env/execution-context object identity.
Type parameters are compile-time contracts rather than runtime validation.
The latter exposes `request`, `env`, and `executionContext`.
Type arguments are caller assertions, not validation of runtime bindings.
Developers remain responsible for not explicitly rendering secrets or passing bindings into Client Components.

The RSC graph imports `@vitejs/plugin-rsc/rsc/server`.
HTML rendering loads the separate SSR entry with `import.meta.viteRsc.loadModule("ssr", "index")`.
Only the Flight Web stream and rendering options cross that boundary, not the environment or execution context.
The SSR graph uses the edge-compatible React DOM renderer and the plugin's SSR Flight client.
The browser graph uses the plugin's browser Flight client and hydration entry.

## Host and build ownership

`@effront/vite` exports the host-independent `effront()` plugin, which owns React, Vite RSC, and the React compiler.
`@effront/cloudflare` exports `effrontCloudflare()`, which owns only the Cloudflare plugin plus the required Worker/SSR environment and SSR-output layout invariants.
Workers applications register both explicitly: `plugins: [effront(), effrontCloudflare()]`.
Cloudflare options, when needed, are passed directly to `effrontCloudflare(...)` rather than nested beneath a `cloudflare` property; the ordinary configuration uses `effrontCloudflare()` with no options.
Do not register React or Vite RSC plugins a second time.
Omitting the Cloudflare adapter leaves the core available for a future Node or Bun host adapter, but neither adapter is implemented in this milestone.
The default RSC entry is the application's `src/entry.workers.ts`, which exports the Workers Fetch object.
The application-definition entry defaults to `src/entry.effront.tsx` and directly exports the application definition.
Despite its name, this definition module stays in the RSC graph rather than becoming the browser hydration entry.
The framework provides the SSR and browser entries.
The Cloudflare wrapper owns the required `viteEnvironment: { name: "rsc", childEnvironments: ["ssr"] }`.
Other Cloudflare options can be supplied through its `cloudflare` option and are forwarded without disabling state persistence or remote bindings.
The wrapper does not set server host, port, strict-port mode, project root, or a Wrangler config path.
Vite runs from the application directory and uses normal configuration discovery.

VitePlus drives Vite and builds the graph-specific outputs.
Wrangler runs the generated `examples/workers/dist/rsc/wrangler.json` using `--local --no-bundle`.
The wrapper places SSR output inside the Worker upload root (by default `dist/rsc/ssr`) so dynamically loaded SSR modules are attached by Wrangler.
Emitting SSR as a sibling `dist/ssr` builds successfully but fails in Wrangler at runtime because that module is not attached to the Worker.
Workers assets are host-owned, not Bun filesystem middleware.
The example's Cloudflare configuration owns the assets binding and runtime variables.
It omits `run_worker_first` and relies on Cloudflare's default asset-first routing.
The generated Wrangler configuration supplies the built client asset directory.
Worker-first routing remains an explicit application choice for cases such as protecting asset requests or overriding a conflicting static URL.
Changing Wrangler runtime variables must not require rebuilding the application.

The package exposes TypeScript source exports for Vite bundling.
The workspace consumer exercises the actual `@effront/core`, `@effront/vite`, `@effront/cloudflare`, and `@effront/core/workers` exports.
This is not a claim of standalone unbundled Node compatibility or published-package readiness.

## Tooling

`vite.config.ts` at the repository root owns formatting, lint, and unit-test configuration.
Formatting and lint rules use VitePlus defaults, matching the source monorepo's baseline formatting.
Ignore patterns only exclude dependencies and generated or temporary output.
The workspace contains the framework and its Workers example.

## Verification contract

- `vp check` checks every retained framework source file, the consumer, and test source.
- `vp test run` checks the retained framework tests, including the public Fetch adapter's request-context and lifecycle behavior.
- `(cd tests/e2e-build && vp run test)` builds its package-local fixture and runs browser acceptance through standalone Wrangler with test runtime bindings.
- `(cd tests/e2e-dev && vp run test)` runs HMR-only acceptance through Vite/workerd with a separate minimal fixture.
- Browser checks cover HTML, Flight, hydrated interaction, navigation, unknown routes, and secret non-disclosure.
- Successful compilation alone does not establish Workers runtime or hydration correctness.

[Observed verification results](WORKERS-VALIDATION.md) map each requirement to its completed local checks.

## Scope

The upstream CLI, Bun server/filesystem hosting, Rspack build machinery, development panel/RPC, Vercel adapter, obsolete examples, and vendored research snapshots have been removed.
Their history is preserved by Git.
Node and Bun can eventually host the same Fetch interface through host adapters, but no adapter or compatibility guarantee is delivered in this milestone.
D1, KV, R2, authentication integrations, and production deployment remain outside the user's requested scope.
