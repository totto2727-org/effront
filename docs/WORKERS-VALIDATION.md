# Workers implementation verification

Verified locally on 2026-09-11, macOS arm64.
Repository: `../effective-rsc-workers`, branch `workers-fetch`.
The upstream history is preserved from `ed886996d1d3780b94166af4f798c53416d547c8`.

## Current naming note

This is a historical validation record from before the Effront rename. Its observed commands, paths, API names, and results remain accurate for that execution and are intentionally unchanged.
Current code uses `@effront/core/*`, `Application.effront()`, and separate `effront()` from `@effront/vite` plus `effrontCloudflare()` from `@effront/cloudflare`; the latter direct options replaced the historical nested `cloudflare` options.

## Requirement-to-evidence mapping

| Requirement                                       | Check and observed result                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workers-native runtime without Bun or a container | Real workerd execution passed through Cloudflare's Vite plugin and through Wrangler `dev --local --no-bundle`.                                                                                                                                  |
| Public Workers Fetch entry                        | The example imports `createFetchHandler` through `effective-rsc/workers` and exports `{ fetch }`; both hosts returned successful HTML and Flight responses.                                                                                     |
| Development server with runtime environment       | `workers-dev` passed all 3 Playwright cases and rendered `APP_LABEL` from the configured Workers variables.                                                                                                                                     |
| Wrangler local hosting independent of Vite        | The runner stopped Vite before starting Wrangler against generated `dist/rsc/wrangler.json`; `workers-wrangler-default` passed all 3 cases.                                                                                                     |
| Runtime env changes without rebuilding            | The same build was started again with `APP_LABEL` and `SERVER_TOKEN` overrides; `workers-wrangler-overridden` passed all 3 cases and rendered the changed label and secret-presence indicator.                                                  |
| No implicit secret serialization                  | HTML, Flight, the rendered body, and a nonempty set of actually loaded browser scripts did not contain the test secret.                                                                                                                         |
| Client hydration and navigation                   | Chromium changed the actual button from `Count: 0` to `Count: 1`, followed About, and returned home on both hosts.                                                                                                                              |
| Development updates                               | A separate browser smoke check changed the Client Component label to `Clicks: 1` through Vite HMR without restarting the server; the source was restored afterward.                                                                             |
| HTTP behavior                                     | HTML and Flight content types, `private, no-store`, `Vary: Accept`, and a 404 for an unknown route passed in all 3 host configurations.                                                                                                         |
| Request isolation and lifecycle                   | The public Fetch adapter test passed per-request Layer acquisition, overlapping env isolation, original request/execution-context identity, EOF disposal, bodyless disposal before return, cancellation exactly once, and stream-error cleanup. |
| VitePlus formatter and linter                     | `vp fmt --check` passed; `vp lint` reported 0 warnings and 0 errors with its 96 default rules. The root config adds ignore patterns, not custom style or lint rules.                                                                            |
| Type safety of active workflow                    | `vp run typecheck` passed for all retained framework source and tests, the example, Playwright config, and browser test source.                                                                                                                 |
| New sibling directory, local changes only         | Implementation is in the cloned sibling directory with local commits. No PR, push, publishing, or cloud deployment was performed.                                                                                                               |

## Historical reproduction commands

For the current checkout, use `vp run fix`, `vp run check`, and `vp run test` from the root.
Then run `vp run test` independently from `tests/e2e-build` for built-artifact acceptance and `tests/e2e-dev` for HMR-only acceptance.
The following commands describe the original verification, not the current task interface.

```sh
vp install
vp fmt --check
vp lint
vp run typecheck
vp test run
(cd tests/e2e && vp run test)
```

Final coordinator execution of `(cd tests/e2e && vp run test)` exited with status 0.
It ran the real build followed by 9 passing browser cases: 3 development, 3 default Wrangler, and 3 overridden Wrangler.
The focused Fetch test is one scenario containing the lifecycle and isolation assertions listed above and passed with `vp test run`.
These adapter checks complement, rather than replace, the real Workers browser acceptance path.

## Integration defects found and fixed

- Request environment must be provided to both Layer acquisition and the request handler's Effect context.
- Vite's RSC optimizer needs the RSC plugin as a direct dependency of the consuming workspace package.
- Worker-first asset routing must not intercept Vite's virtual client bootstrap or built JavaScript assets.
- SSR must build inside `dist/rsc/ssr`, not sibling `dist/ssr`, because Wrangler only attaches modules within the Worker output directory.
  The final RSC bundle imports `./ssr/index.js`, and Wrangler reported attaching `ssr/index.js` plus its supporting modules before returning HTTP 200.

## Artifact audit and cleanup

The final RSC, nested SSR, and client output contained 13 JavaScript, JSON, and CSS files.
Scanning those files found zero matches for `bun:`, `Bun.`, `@effect/platform-bun`, `react-server-dom-rspack`, or `@rspack`.
This static check is supplementary evidence; the workerd acceptance run establishes actual runtime behavior.
The obsolete sibling SSR output from earlier experiments was removed.
The acceptance environment file was removed and ports 5173, 5174, 8787, and 8788 were confirmed closed after verification.

## Scope of this evidence

This verifies the requested local Fetch/env workflow, not every preserved upstream feature or a production deployment.
D1 and other storage integrations, Node/Bun host adapters, and cloud deployment remain explicitly outside this milestone.
The upstream CLI, old build pipeline, old examples, and obsolete integration suites were removed during cleanup.
This is a local Vite source-package consumer, not a published npm package certification.

## Cleanup regression verification

The cleanup reduced the tracked working tree from 7,325 files to 106 while preserving the original Git history.
The final tree contains the framework, Workers example, current documentation, necessary license notices, and runnable tests.
Legacy applications, source snapshots, Bun/Rspack runtime and build tooling, obsolete CI/release/editor configuration, redundant TypeScript/Turbo configuration, and unused dependencies were removed.
No remaining source or configuration refers to the deleted vendor tree, Bun runtime modules, Rspack modules, or the removed custom Effect lint rules.

Verification after the final cleanup:

- Frozen-lockfile installation passed with VitePlus.
- Default VitePlus formatting, lint, and whole-tree type checking passed.
- `vp test run` passed all 156 tests in 26 files, including the now-portable route-scaling test.
- `(cd tests/e2e && vp run test)` passed all 9 real browser cases against Vite/workerd, standalone Wrangler, and the same Wrangler artifact with overridden runtime bindings.
- A local `vp pm pack` audit found 52 package files, all public export targets, resolved catalog versions, and no obsolete runtime, build, vendor, or test directories.
- The required third-party MIT notice was preserved verbatim apart from whitespace and verified inside the tarball.
- Local Markdown links resolved successfully.

The temporary tarball and test output were removed after verification.
No package was published and no PR, push, or cloud deployment was performed.

## Plugin-only configuration verification (2026-09-12)

The Workers example now uses only `plugins: [erscCloudflare()]` in its Vite configuration.
The factory composes ERSC and Cloudflare, owns the RSC/SSR environment wiring, and sets default SSR output inside the Worker directory before Cloudflare resolves its environment defaults.
The host-independent `ersc()` entry remains available.

Removed explicit example settings: Vite root, Wrangler config path, SSR output nesting, server host/port/strict-port, `persistState: false`, `remoteBindings: false`, and `assets.run_worker_first`.
Root scripts enter the example directory for normal Vite and Wrangler discovery.
Only the automated acceptance runner passes fixed dev-server host/port/strict-port flags.

Observed checks:

- `vp build` from `examples/workers` succeeded and emitted `dist/rsc/ssr/index.js`.
- `vp dev` from `examples/workers` with no server flags served HTTP 200 at Vite's default `http://localhost:5173` and rendered the Workers environment label.
- Real Vite `resolveConfig` tests verified default SSR nesting, root output overrides, RSC output overrides, and explicit SSR overrides.
- All 160 tests, formatting, default lint, and whole-tree type checking passed.
- After removing `run_worker_first`, all 9 browser cases again passed in Vite/workerd, standalone Wrangler, and Wrangler with runtime variable overrides.
  The checks included successful HTML/Flight requests, client script loading, hydration, navigation, unknown-route handling, and secret non-disclosure with default asset-first routing.

The actual consumer build also caught two integration problems before acceptance: Node ESM required an explicit `.ts` import in the configuration entry, and the SSR nesting hook had to run before Cloudflare's configuration hook.
Both were corrected and verified through the public package entry and real build, not just a custom hook harness.

## Standard Playwright lifecycle verification (2026-09-12)

The custom E2E runner has been deleted in favor of Playwright's standard `webServer` array.
The package-owned test host points at the unchanged example source, with explicit environment-specific output directories and test-only inspector/persistence isolation.
Unlike the historical sequential runner above, the current configuration keeps three independent hosts running during the matrix and builds each Wrangler artifact separately.
Runtime variable overrides are still supplied only to Wrangler after compilation.
Normal example configuration and its development commands are unchanged.

Observed checks:

- A single `(cd tests/e2e && vp run test)` passed all 9 browser cases, with Playwright logging termination of all three servers.
- Two simultaneous invocations each passed all 9 cases (18 total), using six distinct HTTP ports: 64305 through 64310.
- TCP connection attempts confirmed all six listeners were closed after both invocations completed.
- An intentional `playwright test --timeout 1 --max-failures 1` failure returned exit 1 and closed all three of its listeners (64557 through 64559).
- Standard root Vitest discovery passed 29 files and 176 tests, including the real Git/VitePlus CLI suite.
- VitePlus formatting, default lint, root type checking, and E2E package type checking passed.

Initial acceptance caught that a root-level build output override did not relocate Cloudflare's RSC/client outputs.
The test host now explicitly sets all three environment output directories, keeping nested SSR inside each isolated Worker artifact.
The E2E TypeScript config enables `allowImportingTsExtensions` because the public framework source export uses explicit `.ts` imports; it adds no include/exclude overrides.
Builds, state, failure traces, and test logs remain in the package's ignored `tmp/` directory for diagnosis.
These checks cover local workerd hosting, not cloud deployment.

## Typed request-context factories

The core factory accepts Env and ExecutionContext; the Cloudflare runtime wrapper accepts Env only and fixes the execution context to its waitUntil contract.
Colocated type assertions run through vp check, including rejection of a second Cloudflare factory type argument.
Runtime tests verify identical objects through independent readers of one Layer, reuse of pre-created Effects across distinct request contexts, missing-context failure, and forwarding of the original Promise to waitUntil.
The existing real Fetch handler integration now uses factory-created readers during application Layer acquisition and middleware execution, retaining concurrent request isolation and EOF/cancel/error cleanup checks.
The actual Workers example imports @effront/cloudflare/workers, binds Env once, and calls waitUntil while rendering its About page.
All 250 tests in 35 files passed; Workers acceptance passed nine cases on Vite and independent default/overridden Wrangler hosts, and documentation acceptance passed ten cases.
The Workers build additionally traverses actual module IDs and rejects Cloudflare's Vite entry and Vite/Wrangler tooling in the application graphs.
Actual pnpm tarballs contain the workers exports and exclude colocated tests; the Cloudflare core peer is normalized to ^0.1.4-workers.0.
The workspace pnpm peers check still reports VitePlus alias version and workspace:^ peer-range warnings; this command is not green, while the packaged core peer range and real host execution are verified above.
No registry publication or remote deployment was performed.
