# Effront

## Repository structure

- `packages/core/`: application and Fetch runtime (`@effront/core`).
- `packages/vite/`: portable build integration (`@effront/vite`).
- `packages/cloudflare/`: Cloudflare Vite integration (`@effront/cloudflare`) and separate runtime accessors (`@effront/cloudflare/workers`).
- `packages/markdown/`: Vite glob collections and comark React SSR rendering (`@effront/markdown`).
- `examples/markdown/`: file-relative Markdown routing and asset consumer.
- `examples/workers/`: consumer using the public package exports, Workers `fetch`, and runtime `env`.
- `app/docs/`: SSR Guide, API reference, and implementation architecture site, using the framework itself with shadcn/ui and Tailwind Typography.
- `tests/e2e-build/`: independent Playwright acceptance against its package-local fixture built for standalone Wrangler.
- `tests/e2e-dev/`: independent Vite/workerd HMR acceptance using its own minimal package-local fixture.
- `packages/gitignore-patterns/`: Gitignore generator and its colocated unit / package-owned Vitest CLI integration tests.
- `docs/`: current architecture and verification documentation.
- Removed upstream implementations and references remain available in Git history, not in the working tree.

Workspace discovery uses `app/*`, `packages/*`, `tests/*`, and `examples/*`, without per-project entries.

## Development commands

### Execution rules

- Work in this independent repository at `workspace/package/effront/`, not the parent virtual monorepo.
- Push and create pull requests only in `totto2727-org/effront`, as authorized by the user. Never target the upstream repository. Do not publish packages or deploy without explicit authorization.
- Use VitePlus for formatting, linting, checks, package management, and test entry points.
- Formatting follows the parent workspace's default VitePlus baseline. Lint rules stay at VitePlus defaults. Do not restore the upstream custom Effect/Oxlint rules or add unrelated lint overrides.
- Keep temporary evidence under this repository's ignored `tmp/` directory. Never commit `.dev.vars` or real secrets.
- Local acceptance must not require Cloudflare authentication or remote services.

### Standard tasks

From the repository root:

- `vp install` installs the pinned pnpm workspace dependencies.
- `vp run fix` applies formatting and safe lint fixes through `js:fix` (`vp check --fix`).
- `vp run check` verifies formatting, default lint rules, and types through `js:check` (`vp check`).
- `vp run test` runs retained unit/integration tests through `js:test` (`vp test run`).
- Root aggregate tasks live in `vite.config.ts` `run.tasks`, not duplicated package scripts. Each public package owns its `pack` settings and task in its own `vite.config.ts`.
- `vp run w:pack` runs package-local `pack` tasks recursively in workspace dependency order and generates JavaScript and declarations. Run it before checks and tests so consumers resolve the same `dist/` exports as npm users; CI declares that order explicitly.
- In a public package, both `vp pack` and `vp run pack` generate `dist/`; they do not create npm tarballs. Build the workspace once before starting examples, the documentation site, or package-local browser E2E tests.
- Do not add standalone formatter/linter tasks; use the fix/check workflow.
- Run `vp run test` from `tests/e2e-build/` for built-artifact browser acceptance and from `tests/e2e-dev/` for development HMR acceptance.
- Run `vp run test` from `packages/gitignore-patterns/` for that package's unit and real CLI integration tests.

For the documentation site, enter `app/docs/` and use `vp dev`, `vp build`, or `vp run local`; see [site operations](docs/DOCS-SITE.md).
The site has colocated content and rendering tests; framework browser acceptance uses the independent E2E fixtures rather than starting this site.

To run the example, enter `examples/workers/` and use `vp dev`, `vp build`, or `vp run local`.
The repository root intentionally provides no example dev, build, or local-hosting script.
The root `vite.config.ts` owns repository formatting, linting, and test configuration.

## Architecture

### Runtime boundary

The user's 2026-09-11 requirements explicitly supersede the upstream Bun-only runtime, Rspack compilation, proprietary development server, Vercel packaging, and Bun verification commands.
The common boundary is a Web `Request` to `Response` handler. The initial host is Cloudflare Workers.
Workers-specific `env` and execution context stay behind the host adapter and in request-local Effect context, never implicitly in Flight or HTML.
D1, KV, R2, database abstractions, Node/Bun host adapters, and hosted deployments are outside the current scope.

### Graphs and lifetimes

- Keep browser, RSC, SSR, and tooling graphs explicit. Only the RSC graph resolves React's `react-server` condition.
- RSC and SSR execute in workerd through Cloudflare child environments. Do not fall back to Node SSR in development.
- Scope application services to the request, and preserve their lifetime through response body completion, error, and cancellation.
- Preserve React's native RSC and Server Function protocols. Do not invent a replacement transport.
- Use the generated Wrangler config for built-local execution. Do not ask Wrangler to compile unprocessed RSC source.

## Development tools

- **VitePlus**: unified tooling with the Vite core and Vitest versions pinned in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Cloudflare Vite plugin / Wrangler**: local Workers runtime only.
- **Playwright**: browser validation of actual built and development applications.
- **Effect**: consult the installed version's source and official documentation before changing Effect APIs.
- Keep all retained source and tests covered by root checks. Do not hide legacy files behind tooling exclusions.

## Test placement

- Place unit tests next to their implementation as `<module>.test.ts` or `<module>.test.tsx`.
- Reserve `tests/` for integration or black-box contracts spanning multiple modules or external tools.
- Use standard Vitest discovery without a root `test.include` override.
- Name Playwright browser suites `*.e2e.ts` and select them in the Playwright configuration so Vitest does not collect them.
- Keep colocated tests in source checks, but exclude them from shipped packages and declaration builds.
- See [test boundaries](docs/TESTING.md) for the retained integration suites.

## Package-specific rules

- Keep dependency versions in the shared catalog only when at least two active manifests reference them.
- Preserve explicit public package subpaths rather than exporting internal modules indiscriminately.
- Use path-qualified Effect service identifiers. Keep shared runtime contracts implementation-free.
- Use `Effect.fnUntraced` for framework internals to avoid tracing overhead. Use `Effect.fn` for application code, examples, consumer-facing documentation, and public authoring API tests so applications retain tracing. Keep `Effect.fn.Return` where a generator return type is needed; it is type-only.
- Use typed failures for input and I/O errors, and plain `TypeError` only for violated wiring invariants.
- Do not count a build, mock, or copied-source test as proof that the public Workers fetch path works. Test both `vp dev` and the Vite-independent Wrangler artifact.

## Public documentation audience

- Write common Guide pages for npm package consumers, not contributors cloning this repository.
- Describe Effront as a React meta-framework built on Web standards and Effect; distinguish extensible Fetch boundaries from tested adapter support.
- Keep conceptual guides host-neutral. Getting started may choose a concrete host and must include a complete runnable configuration; put deeper host-specific details in Platforms.
- Prefer affirmative instructions and working examples over statements of what something is not. Reserve negative warnings for necessary correctness, compatibility, or safety constraints.
- Architecture > Implementation chapters explain the current packages/core implementation. Display the reviewed package version and commit, and keep embedded source excerpts synchronized with both that baseline and current files; validate them locally; retain upstream provenance separately in docs/UPSTREAM.md.
- Deferred features belong in docs/ROADMAP.md and must not be presented as implemented APIs.

Each of `tests/e2e-build/` and `tests/e2e-dev/` owns its fixture, Playwright configuration, Vite configuration, and `vp run test` entry point.
Keep one fixed `webServer` command per package: build then standalone Wrangler for `e2e-build`, and Vite development for `e2e-dev`.
The dev package covers HMR only. Do not introduce shared build/dev mode branches or start both hosts from either package.
Run the fixed package-local fixture directly. Keep fixture copying, dynamic run directories, and concurrent-run isolation out of Playwright configuration; HMR tests restore their own file changes in `finally`.

## npm publication

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs checks and tests for pull requests and `main` updates.
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes on pushes to `main`, including merged pull requests, using the template's shared Nix and TypeScript setup actions on `@main`, followed by native pnpm publication through `vp pm publish`.
- Publication is serialized and skips versions already on npm. Bump each changed public package's version in its pull request and update workspace peer ranges through `vp install --lockfile-only` when needed. There is no automatic version bump or tag trigger.
- Public packages are `@effront/core`, `@effront/vite`, `@effront/cloudflare`, and `@effront/markdown`. `@effront/gitignore-patterns` is local development tooling and is not included in this release workflow.
- Each public package owns a `vite.config.ts` and runs only `vp pack` for JavaScript and `.d.ts`. `vp run w:pack` delegates to `vp run -r pack`, which follows workspace dependencies without a hand-maintained list or package-specific `dependsOn`. Publication uses filtered `vp pm publish -r`, which resolves `workspace:` and `catalog:` protocols, creates the tarballs, and skips versions already on npm. No tarball staging or extraction is part of the build or publish workflow. Preserve RSC module directives, runtime entry points, CSS assets, and conditional exports.
- The public packages start at stable version `0.1.0` and use public access with the `latest` dist-tag through `publishConfig`.
- Before merging the publishing workflow, the package owner must ensure all four npm packages exist and configure each Trusted Publisher for GitHub owner `totto2727-org`, repository `effront`, workflow `publish.yml`, and direct publication. No GitHub environment is configured. Initial publication, if required by npm, must be performed by the owner.
- The workflow uses GitHub-hosted runners and job-scoped `id-token: write`, without long-lived npm tokens. Protect `main` and require the CI check before merging. Local checks and dry runs do not verify registry trust or package ownership.
