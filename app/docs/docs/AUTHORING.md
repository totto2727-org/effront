# SSR documentation site

`app/docs` is a private workspace application that uses the public Effront API to render its own documentation.
It combines nine Guide pages, two Platforms pages, five Advanced pages, seven API reference pages, and seven Architecture implementation chapters in one shadcn/ui sidebar.
The content is Japanese, with source identifiers and commands preserved in English.

## Run locally

Install dependencies with `vp install` and build packages with `vp run w:pack` at the repository root, then enter the site application:

```sh
cd app/docs
vp run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:1339` after Alchemy reports that the local Worker is ready.
The script invokes `alchemy dev`; bare `vp dev` invokes Vite directly and bypasses Alchemy orchestration.
Alchemy configures workerd, bindings, and the Vite host without an application-level runtime plugin or Wrangler configuration.
The pinned beta.77 requires a configured Cloudflare profile even when the resources run locally.
If no profile exists, run `vp exec alchemy profile edit --profile default --add Cloudflare` interactively before starting the application.
See [Alchemy integration](../../../packages/alchemy/docs/INTEGRATION.md) for the configuration and verification boundary.

## Production deployment and state

This application uses `Cloudflare.state()` for shared remote state; the examples keep `localState()`.
The stack remains `effront-docs`, and production deployments always use stage `production` rather than a runner-specific default.
Local development keeps Alchemy's separate `dev_<user>` stage, but the docs state backend is Cloudflare, so do not assume that starting this application is credential-free or has no remote state-store operations.
Do not set `ALCHEMY_STAGE=production` when running `alchemy dev`.

The [Deploy documentation workflow](../../../.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml) runs on pushes to `main` and can be dispatched manually from `main` only.
It builds the required workspace packages before invoking `vp run deploy` from `app/docs`.
Repository checks and tests belong to the separate CI workflow and are not repeated or awaited by the deployment workflow.
Deployments are serialized without cancelling an in-progress reconciliation and do not run for pull requests or forks.
Alchemy builds the application as part of deployment; there is no separate Wrangler deployment or local-state artifact to restore.

Before enabling deployment, create the GitHub Environment `docs-production`, restrict it to `main`, and configure any required approval rules.
Set its variable `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` for the intended Cloudflare account.
Credentials are passed only to the deployment step; Alchemy reads them directly in CI without a saved local profile.
The command uses `alchemy deploy --stage production --yes`, including automatic creation or upgrade of Alchemy's account-wide `alchemy-state-store` Worker when needed.
The API token must permit the docs Worker and assets deployment as well as state-store bootstrap/access, including its Durable Objects and Cloudflare Secrets Store resources; a token limited to uploading the docs Worker is not sufficient.
Review the pinned Alchemy provider's required permissions with the account administrator before the first run.
An Alchemy upgrade can also update this shared state-store Worker, so coordinate upgrades with other stacks in the same account.

Changing the backend does not migrate an existing local deployment's state.
If `effront-docs` has already been deployed with local state, preserve that state and complete an explicit migration or adoption review before running this workflow against the same resources.
Do not delete local state or assume that remote state will discover previously managed resources automatically.
For a new, never-deployed production stage, the first approved workflow run initializes remote state.
No cloud deployment or credential/permission validation is implied by local checks.

API and CI behavior were checked against the installed `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.77`; the source URLs track upstream main.

## Rendering and authoring

Pages are JSX functions in `src/content/guides.tsx`, `guide-topics.tsx`, `platforms.tsx`, `advanced.tsx`, `api-reference.tsx`, `core-model.tsx`, and `core-runtime.tsx`.
Effront renders them on each request; no SSG or Markdown parser is involved.
Tailwind Typography styles articles, and the document starts in dark mode regardless of system preference.
Shiki tokenizes code on the server with locally imported grammars and a JavaScript regex engine.
The client receives rendered content and navigation metadata rather than the content registry or highlighter implementation.

The shared RootLayout owns DocsShell, including the sidebar, header, and table of contents; each Page owns its document metadata and article.
The server supplies the destination's navigation metadata as Layout props, while React preserves the shared client shell and its sidebar scroll container during client navigation between routes.
Sidebar search and scroll state belong to that persistent shell, and only the Page article participates in the framework's named page transition.
Document scrolling and heading anchors remain native navigation behavior rather than a global scroll lock.

To add a page, define its stable heading IDs and register its explicit route in `src/entry.effront.tsx`.
Update the catalog count when deliberately changing the number of pages.

## Architecture implementation chapters

- `/architecture/implementation/overview`: the core package's responsibilities and overall request flow.
- `/architecture/implementation/application`: application identity, definitions, services, and middleware views.
- `/architecture/implementation/routing`: route composition, compilation, and page parameter handling.
- `/architecture/implementation/request`: Fetch context, application Layer acquisition, and response resource lifetime.
- `/architecture/implementation/rendering`: Flight, SSR, HTML streaming, and payload embedding.
- `/architecture/implementation/navigation`: browser navigation, publication, and retained render resources.
- `/architecture/implementation/server-functions`: server-side action execution and UI refresh.

The former upstream-comparison chapters and `/reading/*` routes have been removed.
Upstream version, commit records, and license provenance remain in [UPSTREAM.md](../../../docs/UPSTREAM.md).
The site links upstream only through its [official website](https://effective-rsc.nikhilsnayak.dev/).

Architecture excerpts are exact contiguous selections of the current `packages/core/src` files, embedded as authored strings.
`core.test.tsx` compares every excerpt with the current implementation during testing.
The colocated rendering tests cover server-highlighted excerpt output.
Rendering performs no filesystem reads, Git execution, or GitHub requests to obtain code.
When implementation changes, update the relevant explanation and excerpt together.

## Audience

Guide teaches application usage, with a complete Cloudflare-based getting-started example.
Platforms owns host support and configuration.
Advanced explains application-facing runtime guarantees and operational boundaries.
API reference describes the current public package APIs and their type contracts.
Architecture > Implementation explains the framework's current internals, without repeating generic React or Effect tutorials.
Deferred features and alternative Node/Bun hosting designs remain in [ROADMAP.md](../../../docs/ROADMAP.md).
Contributor workflow and framework-level acceptance requirements belong here and in AGENTS.md, not in the consumer testing guide.

## Validation

Run `vp run check` and `vp run test` at the repository root.
The site's colocated tests validate its content registry, rendered headings, source excerpts, and server-side highlighting.
Run `vp run test` from `tests/e2e-build` for framework browser acceptance using its dedicated fixture on the generated Wrangler artifact.
Run `vp run test` from `tests/e2e-dev` for HMR-only acceptance using its separate minimal fixture.
These packages do not start or modify the documentation site.
Each owns one Vite configuration, one Playwright configuration, one fixed webServer command, a fixed fixture and test port, and standard Playwright failure traces.
Verify the documentation application through `vp run dev` from `app/docs` when changing site integration; this is separate from the fixed framework E2E configurations.

The stream injector preserves HTML chunk boundaries and emits embedded Flight payloads after HTML EOF, before the closing document trailer.
Cancellation during a pending Flight flush is covered by the core stream tests.
The explicit Tailwind stylesheet is loaded by `@effront/tailwind` through the Client DocsShell boundary so initial SSR includes its CSS dependency.

## Core chapter replacement validation

On 2026-09-12, `vp run check` passed formatting, lint, and type checks, and `vp run test` passed 273 tests across 36 files.
The documentation acceptance suite passed all 10 cases against separate Vite development and built Wrangler hosts.
The checks covered all 15 pages without JavaScript, all 14 current-source excerpts, navigation and heading links, dark typography, mobile sidebar behavior, and HTML/Flight 404 responses for all five removed Code Reading routes.
The public sidebar links upstream only through its official website.

## Upstream Guide and Advanced coverage

The official Guide and Advanced indexes were reviewed on 2026-09-12.
The site adapts their supported topics to current Effront rather than preserving upstream host-specific guarantees.

| Upstream chapter                      | Effront location                                  | Treatment and reason                                                                                                                                                 |

| Deploying to Vercel                   | `/platforms`                                      | No deployment tutorial: the upstream Vercel adapter was removed and a current adapter is not provided. Platform support is tracked separately from framework guides. |
| Request runtime and lifetimes         | `/advanced/request-runtime-and-lifetimes`         | Retained with request-local application Layer construction and streaming lifetime, replacing upstream server-global runtime assumptions.                             |
| Client navigation                     | `/advanced/client-navigation`                     | Retained for current native Navigation API capabilities, fallback, cancellation, and cache behavior.                                                                 |
| Server Function execution and refresh | `/advanced/server-function-execution-and-refresh` | Retained for result ordering, refresh, and concurrent navigation guarantees.                                                                                         |
| Production startup                    | `/advanced/production-startup`                    | Rewritten for Vite build and host-adapter ownership. Specific host commands live in Platforms.                                                                       |

The removed Bun `ersc build` / `ersc start`, `start({ root, hostname, port })`, `.ersc` deployment layout, and `BuildHook` adapter API are not current Effront APIs.
Production startup therefore teaches the replacement build/host boundary rather than documenting those commands as usable.
The old development warning panel is not part of the retained browser runtime, so its UI is not described as an available feature.
Generic React and Effect concepts are linked to their official documentation, as requested, while Effront-specific Component usage and consumer testing remain useful additional guides.
Page ViewTransition defaults and overrides are documented in Advanced and API reference.
Future Node/Bun/Vercel hosting remains in ROADMAP.md.

## Architecture baseline and hierarchy

The sidebar and breadcrumb hierarchy is `アーキテクチャ > 実装解説 > chapter`, with a nested semantic list rather than another peer section.
Each implementation chapter displays `effront@0.1.4-workers.0`, baseline commit `68f3dfc809ec11a881b9b857648a3541abd78503`, and review date `2026-09-12`.
These values describe the implementation being explained, not the latest documentation commit or an assertion of npm publication.
The authored baseline is in `src/content/architecture-baseline.ts`.
Tests compare its package version and every implementation excerpt against that exact local Git object, in addition to comparing current source files.
Re-review the text and update the baseline deliberately when core implementation changes.

## Guide, Advanced, API reference, and hierarchy validation

The expanded site has 30 pages: nine Guide pages, two Platforms pages, five Advanced pages, seven API reference pages, and seven nested Architecture implementation chapters.
On 2026-09-12, the full suite passed 297 tests in 38 files, including four public Fetch integration cases for service-backed userland HTTP, request isolation, JSON status, resource release, and scoped/global middleware behavior.
An unmatched route returns 404 without the example's success-only `Effect.map` header; the Guide states this explicitly.
All 10 documentation browser cases passed against Vite development and independently hosted Wrangler builds, including no-JavaScript traversal of all pages, current-source and baseline metadata checks, nested semantic navigation, and mobile checks for new API and Advanced pages.
A long API identifier initially overflowed the desktop table of contents; applying word wrapping to TOC links resolved the observed overflow and the rerun passed.
The Guide author checked 18 extracted source files and the API reference author checked 17 CodeBlock examples against the installed public package types with the imports and surrounding definitions stated in the text.
Those extracted fixtures are temporary and are not substitutes for the real Fetch and browser acceptance checks above.

## Shared sidebar validation

On 2026-09-12, the shared Layout change passed `vp run check` and all 308 Vitest tests.
Real Vite and standalone Wrangler browser checks retain the sidebar, overflow container, and input DOM identities, the search query, and nonzero sidebar scroll through sidebar links, article links, previous/next links, and Back/Forward.
The history check changes the sidebar position on the destination before traversing, verifying that it retains the latest position rather than restoring an older entry's sidebar offset.
The active link, title, breadcrumb, and table of contents update for the destination, while document scrolling and heading anchors continue to work.
Native animation samples and observed capture styles confirm that `effront-page` captures the article and excludes the sidebar.
